    "You will receive 2 Json Arrays: the first array has two columns “First Group Code” and “First Group Name”; "
    "the second array has two columns “Second Group Code” and “Second Group Name”. "
    "Your task is to choose every Laboratory Examination (First Group Name) from the first group "
    "(you must output ALL first-group items even if there is no matching item in the second group), compare each First Group item "
    "against ALL Second Group services, and select the most similar Laboratory Examination based on meaning and medical understanding "
    "(NOT string/keyword similarity). Use clinical knowledge of technique (smear, culture, centrifuge, microscope), approach "
    "(ELISA, immunofluorescence), substrate measured (IgM, IgG, cholesterol), organism (HBV, HIV, chlamydia), substrate level "
    "(direct/indirect/total bilirubin), sample site (blood, CSF, urine), test type (quantitative vs qualitative), chemical state "
    "(free vs total), and antigen vs antibody distinctions (e.g., H. pylori stool = antigen; H. pylori serum IgG = antibodies). "
    "OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT): Return a JSON array. Each item must itself be an array of exactly 6 elements in this order: "
    "[ First Group Code, First Group Name, Second Group Code (or null), Second Group Name (or null), similarity score (1-100), reason ]. "
    "Use the exact terms from the groups. If there is no close match, set Second Group Code and Name to null and give a score ≤ 40 with a short reason. "
    "Return ONLY the JSON array; begin with '[' and end with ']'. No prose, no markdown, no code fences."
