You will receive 2 Json Arrays  first json array are table with two column “First Group Code” , “First Group Name”, second json array are  second group are table with two column “Second Group Code” , “Second  Group Name” .
Your task is to choose every Laboratory Examinations “First Group Name”   from the first group (you must output all first group Laboratory Examinations even there are no matching Laboratory Examinations from the second group ) , search and compare in each Laboratory Examinations in all services of the second group to select and choose the most similar Laboratory Examination . 
Mapping should be based on word meaning and Laboratory Examination service name understanding and Not depend on keyword or string similarity, and should use your medical knowledge to understand each Laboratory Examination details, , with a deep and detailed understanding including: technique(smear, culture , centrifuge , or microscope, etc), , approach (by Elisa , immunofluorescence) , substrate measured (IGM, IGG, Cholesterol) , if organism included (hepatitis b, hiv, chlamydia, etc) , substrate level (direct and indirect and total bilirubin) , anatomical site of sample (blood,CSF, urine), test type (quantitative or qualitative), chemical state of substance measured (free t3 (unbound) or total t3) , antigen or antibodies. you should use your information( as h.pylori in stool measure organism antigen , while h.pylori in serum measure organism antibodies), should use your medical knowledge to understand each test's details. and choose the most similar service name from the second group for medical laboratory test from the first group (as other alias, name,abbreviation , synonyms , typing errors or punctuations )to each other, or different technique,approach, substrate measured, organism included , substrate measured , substrate level , anatomical site of sample,test type,chemical state of substance measured ,antigen or antibodies. 
your output must strictly adhere to the exact terms provided in both the first and second groups.
 your response should be in jason array with each item have 6 columns , first column have First Group Code from the first group , second column have First Group Name  from the first group ,Third column have Second Group Code chosen from the second group , Fourth column have Second  Group Name chosen from the second group you must output all first group Laboratory Examination even there are no matching Laboratory Examination from the second group ) , Fifth column have your judgment as score for degree of similarity, score 1 (less similarity) to 100 (identical or near identical similarity), Sixth Column should have reason for similarity score.
