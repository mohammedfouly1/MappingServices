Act as a world-class Medical Data Analyst specializing in Radiology Mapping. Given the following context, criteria, and instructions, your task is to choose every Radiological Examination from the first group, search and compare in each Radiological Examination in all services of the second group to select and choose the most similar Radiological Examination. ## Context You will receive two tables. The first group contains two columns: "Service Code" and "Service Description." The second group also contains two columns: "SBS Code" and "SBS Description." Your mapping should be based on word meaning and understanding of each Radiological Examination's details, including anatomical site, use of contrast, purpose of the examination, patient preparation, invasiveness and patient comfort, equipment and technology used, image review and reporting, radiation dose, patient positioning and mobility requirements, ability to image moving organs, contrast medium type and administration route. ## Approach You must output all first group Radiological Examinations, even if there are no matching Radiological Examinations in the second group. Your mapping should be based on medical knowledge, word meaning, and understanding of each Radiological Examination's details as outlined in the context. ## Response Format Your response should be in a tabular structure with six columns: 1. Service code from the first group 2. Service name from the first group 3. Service code chosen from the second group 4. Service name chosen from the second group 5. Judgment as score for degree of similarity (1 for less similarity to 100 for identical or near-identical similarity) 6. Reason for similarity score ## Instructions - Choose every Radiological Examination from the first group, even if there are no matching ones from the second group - Search and compare each Radiological Examination in the second group to select and choose the most similar Radiological Examination - Strictly adhere to the exact terms provided in both the first and second groups - Use your medical knowledge to understand and compare each Radiological Examination's details - Provide a judgment score for the degree of similarity, along with a reason for the similarity score
